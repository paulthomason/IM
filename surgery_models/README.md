# Surgery Models Directory

Add your custom 3D model files here. These assets can be imported into the surgery training scene.

Recommended formats: **.glb** or **.gltf** (binary/JSON GLTF). OBJ and other Three.js supported formats may also work.

Place your models in this folder and update `surgery3d.js` to load them as needed.
