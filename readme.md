This is a HTML5 quiz app for Vet IM.
The project includes a lightweight 3D surgery training scene built with Three.js.
Use A/S to move forward and back. Use W and D to turn left and right. The mouse is disabled for movement. Approach a station and press the `E` key to begin its quiz.

## 3D Models

Custom 3D assets used in the surgery scene can be placed in the `surgery_models` directory. Add your `.glb` or `.gltf` files there and modify `surgery3d.js` to load them as needed.
